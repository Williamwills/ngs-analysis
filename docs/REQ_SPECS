NGS Analysis Pipeline Framework Specifications

- Transparency - Able to see and edit what goes on in the data processing pipeline
- Easily modifiable for user's needs
- Run modes
	- Single node - define max number of threads/processes to use
	- Cluster - SGE
	- Define max memory
	- Output run status
- Record benchmarking data for each step
	- reads, sequences
	- time
	- file sizes
	- memory use
- Generate QC and analyses reports

- Improvements over previous pipeline
	- number of threads option for base calling
	- automatic generation of reports/images/plots

======================================================================================
Development

- SGE Pipeline
	- Pipeline to go from basecalling to vcf calls
		- Use samplesheet to generate adapter sequence input for cutadapt.sh
		- Sanity check for SampleSheet.csv
			- Same index for same lane
			- Length of index sequence
			- Total number of commas should be |rows| x (|columns|-1)
			- Remove space, forward or backward slashes
			- No period in sample name
			- Character set - check illumina manual
	- Fastq scores plotting
		- positional averages, quartiles, median, max, and min
		- cumulative distribution of scores
- Documentation of python library
	- Class objects, functions
	- XML format standards
- QC Reporting tools
	- Generate sequence statistics, alignment reports as HTML
		- R graphics library
		- jinja2
- Unit tests for python library
- Statistics gathering and reports
	- runtime, memory, run status
- Improvements to SGE Pipeline
	- Benchmark various read counts
	- Resource usage requests based on benchmarking data
	- Runtime optimization
		- Merge fastq_scores.py with fastq_stats.py to save time on file io.
	- Pipeline visualization (dot)

TESTING

- Create spreadsheet with a row for every single script
- Test
	- input parameters
		- parameter count
		- input file(s) recognition - i.e. all the bam files, etc
		- thread count
		- target region option
	- script runs and finishes with no errors
	- resulting outputs
		- wes
		- wgs
